# Cryptographic Tools: Text & Image Encryption

This repository contains a collection of Python-based cryptographic implementations designed for secure data handling. It includes scripts for both standard text-based encryption and pixel-level image encryption.

## Features
* Text Encryption: Securely encrypts and decrypts string data using cryptographic algorithms.
* Image Encryption: Performs manipulation on image pixels such as XOR operations or shuffling to render images unreadable without the correct key.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed. You may also need the `Pillow` library for image processing:
```bash
pip install Pillow
```

## How to Run
To use the tools, navigate to the directory and run the scripts :

1. Text encryption
   Run
   python3 Playfair_cipher.py

2. Image encryption
   Run
   python3 Image_encryption.py
